    <h3 id="passed-lvl-1-exams--went-for-a-vacation">Passed lvl-1 Exams &amp; Went for a Vacation</h3>
<p>After exams ended, on very next day, I with my family went for a trip. Fun vacation. Good time with family.</p>
<p>After vacations, got the results and I passed this exam. But I&rsquo;m not much happy with my aggregate marks (main matter is to pass this exam but there are some perks of scoring high), so I have made a promise with myself that I will kill it in the level-2 exams which will be in november this year.</p>
<p>And oh I got good marks in law and my teacher promised to take those of with good marks to dinner. Yay.</p>

<h3 id="what-im-reading">What I&rsquo;m Reading</h3>
<p>Guess who sucks at reading books. Me. But as a new year resolution, I&rsquo;m trying to pick up this hobby and got some recommendations by a acquaintance. So this is what I&rsquo;m reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the Coffee Gets Cold ~ Toshikazu Kawaguchi</li>
<li>This is How You Loose Time War ~ Amal el-Mohtar, Max Gladstone</li>
<li>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind ~ Yuval Noah Harari</li>
</ul>
<p>Books I read recently (actually a few months ago, but I wanted to share it):</p>
<ul>
<li>Man&rsquo;s Search For Meaning ~ Viktor Frankl</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learnt few things from this book. Maybe I will reread and write about it later. Though I did not read the Logotherapy part.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p><em>Fun Fact: I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of anime.</em> This season I&rsquo;m watching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End</li>
<li>Classroom of The Elite</li>
<li>The Apothecary Diaries</li>
<li>Solo Leveling</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, anime episode are usually of 20 mins each. That means I&rsquo;m watching 1.5 hours of anime weekly.</p>
<p>Apart from anime, I&rsquo;m watching webseries -</p>
<ul>
<li>Peaky Blinders. It&rsquo;s good and would recommend too and I&rsquo;ve reached last season.</li>
<li>Panchayat. (It also is good. A bit different. Just started season 1)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This format is inspired by <a href="https://macwright.com/">Tom MacWright&rsquo;s blog</a>. It gave a good idea for what to write and the first blog post is here.</p>

<p>While writing this post me realised, I&rsquo;m doing a lot of &lsquo;I&rsquo;. I need some better words. My vocab is bad. Maybe writing blogs will bring some improvement along the way.</p>
