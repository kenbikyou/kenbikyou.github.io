      <description>Started using Obsidian (Again) &amp;amp; PKM This week I created this folder which I intend to contain my notes and documents and photos and other details. Basically everything. But this is different from my home folder okay. Like I don&amp;rsquo;t keep downloads and all screenshots I take, backup of my phone etc. Is this what they call Personal Knowledge Management(PKM)? I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.&#xA;And oh I decided to use obsidian for this purpose.</description>

      <description>Passed lvl-1 Exams &amp;amp; Went for a Vacation After exams ended, on very next day, I with my family went for a trip. Fun vacation. Good time with family.&#xA;After vacations, got the results and I passed this exam. But I&amp;rsquo;m not much happy with my aggregate marks (main matter is to pass this exam but there are some perks of scoring high), so I have made a promise with myself that I will kill it in the level-2 exams which will be in november this year.</description>
