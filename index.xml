      <description>Passed lvl-1 Exams &amp;amp; Went for a Vacation After exams ended, on very next day, I with my family went for a trip. Fun vacation. Good time with family.&#xA;After vacations, got the results and I passed this exam. But I&amp;rsquo;m not much happy with my aggregate marks (main matter is to pass this exam but there are some perks of scoring high), so I have made a promise with myself that I will kill it in the level-2 exams which will be in november this year.</description>
