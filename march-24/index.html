    <h3 id="started-using-obsidian-again--pkm">Started using Obsidian (Again) &amp; PKM</h3>
<p>This week I created this folder which I intend to contain my notes and documents and photos and other details. Basically everything. But this is different from my home folder okay. Like I don&rsquo;t keep downloads and all screenshots I take, backup of my phone etc. Is this what they call Personal Knowledge Management(PKM)? I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>And oh I decided to use obsidian for this purpose. On left there is directory tree. (It can also open pdfs.) And I can typeout my &ldquo;notes&rdquo; in markdown. By notes I don&rsquo;t include my study related notes. That I like to keep mainly in actual books and notebooks.</p>
<p>By again in heading: Last time I used obsidian I went into the rabbit hole of themes, plugins, best system to do thing and what not. I realised, it was waste of time so deleted obsidian. Now I&rsquo;m back to it but I will not do the same mistake again. Just that.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-increase-calories-consumption">Trying to increase calories consumption</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit underweight, thus the need to increase my calories intake.</p>
<p>Goal: 2500 kcal per day.</p>
<p>I have yet to understand the measuring system as I had never bothered to learn this stuff yet. But from an estimate I think I consume near 1800 kcal per day. This is not enough.
I will share a update on this one next month.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-im-reading">What Iâ€™m Reading</h3>
<p>Ok I&rsquo;ll be honest. None of the books I listed on previous post got any reading. Like none.
So the list is same this time again but I really promise I&rsquo;ll read completely atleast one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the Coffee Gets Cold ~ Toshikazu Kawaguchi</li>
<li>This is How You Loose Time War ~ Amal el-Mohtar, Max Gladstone</li>
<li>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind ~ Yuval Noah Harari</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>Same anime are continuing from last post but add to that: Ninja Kamui.</p>
<p>Peaky Blinder is done. Good stuff, would recommend. And Panchayat is put on hold and I will resume it later when I get time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="this-month-i-want-to">This month I want to</h3>
<ul>
<li>end the bit of backlog I got &amp; complete those chapters</li>
<li>figure out good system for
<ul>
<li>this PKM</li>
<li>increase calorie consumption</li>
<li>studies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>have fun on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi">Holi</a></li>
<li>start with basic calisthenics</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="also">Also</h3>
<p>Had my first experience of theater on 22 Feb. Movie was &ldquo;Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc&rdquo;, an anime movie ofc and it was good. (And my god food is so expensive in malls)</p>
<p>-x-</p>
<p>Went to a &ldquo;success party&rdquo; on clearing level 1 exam. The food was bad though icecream was nice.</p>
<p>-x-</p>
<p>Load of studies is getting heavy and will be heavier in near future. There are 6 papers for which I have to study for. And like 10 subjects I think which would combine to make these 6 papers.</p>
